Your System Should Have 3 Interfaces

To create real value, you must separate the system into 3 devices:

🍽️ A. Waiter/Tablet App (order-taking)

Device: tablets or phones for waiters
Purpose: take orders FAST

It should allow:

select table

add items to cart

special instructions (no spice, no salt, etc.)

send order to kitchen

leave note

adjust quantity

see order status in real time

This is the MOST IMPORTANT interface because it's used the MOST.

👨‍🍳 B. Kitchen Display System (KDS)

Device: TV, tablet, or old monitor
Purpose: show orders clearly

It should show:

New orders

Items grouped by category (grill, drinks, dessert, etc.)

Priority

Timer per order

"Preparing" → "Ready" buttons

Sound notification (ding!)

Real-time sync with waiters

This is VALUE: faster kitchen operation, fewer mistakes.

🧾 C. Admin Dashboard

Device: manager’s laptop or admin tablet
Purpose: control the entire restaurant

It should allow:

Manage menu

Manage tables

View analytics

Add waiters

Change prices

View reports

This makes the system “professional,” not just CRUD.
